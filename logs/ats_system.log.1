2025-05-20 23:56:39,140 - [4e1fe998-3428-4dc9-b8c3-16f9bc6eca12] - ATS - DEBUG - LLM response: Based on the provided job requirements and the resume, I would give a score of 80 out of 100.

Here's why:

**Matching skills and experience:**

* The job requires 0.6-18 months of experience, and the candidate has internships and associate software engineer experience, which matches the requirement.
* The job requires skills in Java, J2EE, XML, unit testing, shell scripting, and RDBMS, and the candidate has skills in Java, Python, shell scripting, and RDBMS (MySQL, PostgreSQL).
* The job requires experience in continuous integration, test coverage, and working in various development methodologies, and the candidate has experience with CI/CD tools, unit testing frameworks, and version control.

**Additional skills and certifications:**

* The candidate has additional skills in Reactjs, Tensorflow, Keras, Scikit-learn, Azure ML Studio, Apache Kafka, Docker, Git, Postman, ElasticSearch, Power BI, Tableau, Advance Excel, and SAP HANA, which are not required but are a plus.
* The candidate has certifications in Microsoft Certified Azure AI-900 and Google TensorFlow Developer Certified, which are relevant to the job.

**Gaps:**

* The job requires experience in functional programming, integration testing, and hybrid work environments, which are not explicitly mentioned in the candidate's resume.
* The candidate's experience is mostly in Python, and the job requires Java, J2EE, and XML, which might require additional training or learning.

Overall, the resume matches the job description, and the candidate has additional skills and certifications that are relevant to the job. However, there are some gaps in experience and skills that might require additional training or learning....

To improve the resume, I would suggest:
